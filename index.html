Nielsen (s204072) & Philip J. F. Helsted (s204147)</em></p><h2 id=introduction-and-motivation>Introduction and Motivation</h2><p>Wikipedia is an enormous database of knowledge about everything and anything and history is definitely
well-documented on Wikipedia. The time period of the Cold War, and the corresponding Wikipedia article, is an
interesting piece both of and on history about a highly factionalized
world divided in east and west and communism and capitalism.
The most well-documented Wikipedia is the English Wikipedia, which raises the question of bias
in the way this conflict and its referenced works are described. Is there for instance a notable difference in the
sentiment of articles about the Eastern bloc compared to articles about the Western bloc? Or are there differences in
the language used that cannot be explained by the difference in topic? These are the kinds of questions we are trying
to answer with this webpage.</p><h2 id=the-data>The Data</h2><p>The data that have been used for this project, was obtained by web-scraping some articles on Wikipedia. The first
article that was scraped, and therefore used as a starting point, was the article about the Cold War.
From there all references to other Wikipedia articles present in the body-text were collected and each of these were
in-turn scraped for references. This resulted in a collection of articles all of which were referenced on the Cold War,
and for each of these we had the articles they themselves referenced. Apart from the references, we also collected the
first few paragraphs of text, and the categories of the articles. The text was collected as a way to explore the
language used in the articles and the categories were collected to assign a label of person or event to each of the
articles.</p><p>This resulted in a data-collection of 859 rows, where each row represents a reference from the Cold War article. In
total the amount of data summed to be approximately 40 MB of text data. Each row are described by 7 variables:</p><pre><code>URL, TITLE, LIST OF REFERENCES, LIST OF PARAGRAPH TEXTS, CATEGORIES, TYPE, TOKENS and UNIQUE TOKENS
</code></pre><p>Of these, the most
important ones are the list of references and the list of paragraphs. The list of references is the variable containing
the articles referenced, and is the one being used to build the network. The list of paragraphs is the first couple of
paragraphs from the article, and are used to build both the tokens and the unique tokens. These are also added as an
attribute in the network, and used to explore the language of the articles.</p><h4 id=sample-rows-from-the-data-frame>Sample rows from the data-frame?</h4><h2 id=the-network>The Network</h2><p>As mentioned, the network was constructed from the data set by using the list of references that was scraped for each
of the articles. This was done by creating a node for each article, and creating an edge for each reference to the
referenced article. The resulting full network had in total <code>857</code> nodes and <code>16216</code> edges. To simplify things a bit, we
decided to make the Network undirected as that allowed us to better detect and understand the communities found in the
network.</p><h1 id=insert-image-of-the-full-network>INSERT IMAGE OF THE FULL NETWORK</h1><h3 id=subgraphs>Subgraphs</h3><p>To facilitate a deeper understanding of the network, we decided to create some subgraphs of the network. We had built
a heuristic for collecting the type of article, divided in person, event and none, and used this to assign each of the
nodes in the network a type. We could then use this to filter away all nodes of different type, such that the nodes left
were the ones of the same type. This enabled us to look exclusively at both persons and events related to the Cold War,
in effect allowing us to zoom in on the parts that were the most relevant to us.</p><h1 id=insert-image-of-subgraphs-person-and-event>INSERT IMAGE OF SUBGRAPHS PERSON AND EVENT</h1><h4 id=community-detection>Community detection</h4><p>A way in which we wanted to explore the network and the underlying data, was to detect communities within the network.
Communities would tell us something about how the network was connected, and we hoped that it would show us a clear
divide in, for instance, east and west, capitalism and communism and so on. What we found was that in the Person
subgraph, some clear communities appeared. We found communities of for instance U.S. presidents, Soviet presidents,
East-Asian Leaders, all grouped quite neatly in communities.</p><h1 id=insert-image-of-person-communities-graph>INSERT IMAGE OF PERSON COMMUNITIES GRAPH</h1><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left></div><div class=text-right><p><a href=./Data%20description class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">Next
