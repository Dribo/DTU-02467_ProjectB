We picked this text because we
wanted to capture the essence of the article without having to analyse all the available text.</p><blockquote><p>Example of introductory paragraph</p></blockquote><p>Each of these texts then represented one document in our corpus, where the corpus is the entire collection of documents,
either from the full data set or from the communities found within the network.</p><h2 id=preprocessing-of-text><em>Preprocessing of text</em></h2><p>The first steps of any text-based task, is to pre-process the text and make it usable for the tasks one wants to use
the text for. For our approach, we wanted to have the text uniform in terms of capitalisation and to remove punctuation.
We also needed it to be one long string and not a list of strings.</p><p>Instead of writing our own code for analysing the text, we made use of already written libraries for text analysis from
SKlearn. This way we knew that the code would be robust, and it made it easier to get the correct values for the
analysis. As SKlearn already had methods for tf-idf vectorisation, we could use those and therefore focus more on the
analysis than writing functioning code. The SKlearn functions combines the pre-processing of lowering the text, such
that all letters are de-capitalised and the tokenization, where the texts are reduced to the individual terms which
appear in the text.</p><h2 id=tf-idf><em>TF-IDF</em></h2><p>The method we used for understanding the text was TF-IDF vectorisation. TF-IDF is a method that uses two parts:</p><blockquote><p>TF stands for Term Frequency and represents how often a term occurs in one document.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>IDF stands for Inverse Document Frequency and represents the inverse of how many documents the term occurs in, in the
entire corpus</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The final TF-IDF value is then arrived at by multiplying the TF value with the IDF value</p></blockquote><p>This final TF-IDF value is then a numerical value that represents how important a term is across the entire corpus.
This means that words that occur frequently in just a few documents will have a higher TF-IDF value and therefore count
as being more significant than words that occur less frequently. On the other hand, words that occur in only a few
documents, but occur very frequently in these documents, will also be seen as significant to that document.</p><p>Doing this we can get an understanding of which words are most defining for the documents, and also for the individual
communities that we have found in the network.</p><h2 id=top-terms-the-dataset><em>Top terms the dataset</em></h2><p>When looking at the entire data set, we can use TF-IDF to extract what the top terms for the data set are. As mentioned
these words will be the ones that are most important and indicative of the theme of the dataset.
The top 10 terms for the entire dataset are these following 10 terms</p><blockquote><p>Insert top 10 terms here</p></blockquote><p>We see that these top terms all relate to &mldr;</p><h2 id=top-terms-in-communities><em>Top terms in Communities</em></h2><p>Within the communities in the network we have used TF-IDF to extract the top terms of each of these communities. For
instance community 0, which is a community where the 3 most connected nodes are the articles about U.S. presidents
<code>Richard Nixon</code>, <code>Dwight Eisenhower</code> and <code>Harry Truman</code>, have the top 10 terms</p><pre><code>kennan, macarthur, eisenhower, gaulle, 
reagan, bush, reza, hoover, wilson, carter
</code></pre><p>All of these terms are names of presidents or leaders, which tell us something about what the community is about. In the
case of community 0, the top terms reinforce the fact that this community has encapsulated the presidents of the western
world, especially the presidents of the US. Another observation to be made is that the term <code>gaulle</code> has been captured,
which references the French general and president <code>Charles le Gaulle</code>, which indicates that he is significant for these
articles, and by extension that he had some relevance to the people the articles are about.</p><p>Another community worth looking at is community 1, which consists of articles about leaders of the Soviet Union. The
top articles in this community are the articles about <code>Nikita Krushchev</code>, <code>mikhail Grobachev</code> and <code>Vladimir Lenin</code>. Here
we see the following top terms:</p><pre><code>putin, gorbachev, yeltsin, amin, andropov, 
solzhenitsyn, taraki, kosygin, suslov, podgorny
</code></pre><p>Again it is very much the same picture as before. All of these top terms underlines what the community is about, namely
Soviet presidents and leaders; all people that played a significant role during the Cold War and in the events which
occurred during the Cold War.</p><h2 id=word-clouds><em>Word clouds</em></h2><p>Another way to visualise the differences in the words used in each community, is the word cloud. This is a simple method
for generating pleasing visuals of the words in a text, and gives an intuitive overview of what words are the most
common in a given document.</p><p><img src=../images/wordclouds.png alt></p><p>These word clouds are from made from the texts found in 9 of the communities in event and degree filtered subgraph.
Above each word cloud is the 3 highest degree articles listed from each of the communities. What we see in these word
clouds is that there are some clear differences in the words that occur most frequently, but also that some words are
frequent in all 9 communities. This allows us to get insights into what the theme of the community is. For instance, the
first community (top left) contains words <code>Soviet</code>, <code>German</code>, <code>Germany</code>, <code>Russian</code> all 4 of which are very prominent,
and the top article is the one about the Eastern Front during World War 2. From this we can infer that this community
contains articles about Germany, The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc in general. We can furthermore see that it is
quite different from the word cloud from community 2 (top middle), which highlights words such as <code>Isreal</code>, <code>Isreali</code>
and <code>British</code>, and seems to be more about the British Empire, Israel and events that occurred in relation to these
countries.</p><p>Throughout, we see that all the word clouds are quite different and that each of them include unique words which belong
only to that community. Another observation to be made, is that the word <code>Soviet</code> is prominent in almost all
word clouds, indicating the huge relevance the Soviet Union had on the entire time period.</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left><p><a href=../network-analysis class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">&lt;
